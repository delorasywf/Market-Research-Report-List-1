<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Specimen Retrieval Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Detachable</li><li>Non-detachable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The specimen retrieval market is categorized into two primary types: detachable and non-detachable. Detachable retrieval devices allow the user to separate the specimen from the retrieval mechanism after collection, facilitating easier handling and transfer. In contrast, non-detachable devices maintain continuous attachment to the specimen until the procedure is complete, ensuring secure transport but requiring careful management of the device. Both types are crucial in minimally invasive surgeries for efficient specimen collection and optimal surgical outcomes.</p></p>
